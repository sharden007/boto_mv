boto3  package is the official Amazon Web Services 
(AWS) SDK for Python that allows developers to create 
software that can interact and use services hosted by 
Amazon, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and more.

Once installed, you have to set up the necessary environment 
variables for authentication, which look something like this:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID – the access key ID for the IAM user.
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY – the secret access key corresponding to 
the access key ID.
